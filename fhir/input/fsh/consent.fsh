// These are the only two canonical URLs Max Health mints for consent. Both were
// previously string literals in the proxy backend and again in the consent
// portal, defined nowhere and therefore unvalidatable — a typo in either copy
// silently broke SHL revocation, which matches shares on the identifier system.
// Defining them here makes the canonicals resolvable and lets the profile below
// enforce them.
//
// Note this CodeSystem covers only codes WE mint. A base MaxHealthConsent
// categorises with LOINC (57016-8, privacy policy acknowledgment), so
// MaxHealthConsent.category is deliberately left unbound.

// Share Consent — a SMART Health Link (SHL) modelled as a Consent
//
// A patient-initiated share IS a consent grant: the patient (performer) permits
// a recipient (provision.actor) to access a scoped set of resource classes
// until the link expires (provision.period.end == the SHL's expiresAt).
//
// Consent.identifier carries the SHL session id so the proxy can reconcile the
// Consent with its SHL session store (mint → active, revoke → inactive+delete).
