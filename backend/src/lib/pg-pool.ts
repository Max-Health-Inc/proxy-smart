/**
 * Shared PostgreSQL connection pool and connection-string resolution.
 *
 * A single process-wide `pg.Pool`, so every store that needs Postgres
 * (admin-config store today; mtls-store can adopt it later) shares one pool
 * instead of each opening its own. This avoids exhausting the RDS connection
 * budget under scale-out.
 *
 * Connection string resolution (single source of truth for all stores):
 *  1. `DATABASE_URL` if set (used by local dev and the beta docker-compose).
 *  2. Otherwise assembled from discrete `PG*` parts (`PGHOST`, `PGUSER`,
 *     `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGPORT`). This mirrors how the Keycloak ECS
 *     task injects DB credentials as separate Secrets Manager secrets rather
 *     than embedding the password into a single concatenated string — so the
 *     password never appears in a plain task-definition env var.
 *
 * Lazily constructed on first use so importing this module has no side effects
 * when no database is configured.

/**
 * TLS settings for the pool.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES. node-pg defaults to `ssl: false` — it never even attempts
 * TLS. RDS Postgres 15+ ships `rds.force_ssl = 1` by default, so every query from
 * production was rejected before it ran:
 *
 *   no pg_hba.conf entry for host "10.0.3.67", user "keycloak",
 *   database "proxy_smart", no encryption
 *
 * That took the FHIR proxy down entirely, because resolving a FHIR server reads
 * the admin-config store. Keycloak against the SAME instance was fine, which is
 * what made it confusing: the PostgreSQL JDBC driver defaults to
 * `sslmode=prefer`, so it negotiates TLS without being asked. node-pg does not.
 *
 * Configured explicitly here rather than through `?sslmode=` on the URL, because
 * pg 8.x maps `require` onto verify-full semantics and warns that pg 9 will change
 * that. An explicit object behaves the same across versions.
 *
 *   PGSSLROOTCERT  path to a CA bundle → verified TLS (what production uses; the
 *                  Amazon RDS bundle is baked into the image by Dockerfile)
 *   PGSSLMODE=no-verify  → encrypted but UNVERIFIED, for an environment with a
 *                  self-signed certificate. Warns, because it accepts any cert.
 *   neither        → no TLS, for local dev and the beta compose Postgres, which
 *                  is a container on a private network without force_ssl.

 * resolving a FHIR server reads the admin-config store, and the store is in here.
 *
 * Doing it at startup rather than in the deploy pipeline means a brand-new environment — the second
 * region, a fresh beta volume, a laptop — comes up complete without anyone remembering a step.
 *
 * Idempotent and safe to race: several tasks boot together, so `42P04` (duplicate_database) means
 * another task won and is a success, not an error. Never throws — an unreachable maintenance
 * database leaves the resilient file backend to cover it, exactly as before.
