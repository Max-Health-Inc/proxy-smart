/**
 * Registration access tokens for the RFC 7592 client configuration endpoint.
 *
 * RFC 7591 registration returns a `registration_access_token`; the client presents it as a
 * bearer token to read or delete its own registration. It is a credential for exactly one
 * client, so it is stored the way a credential should be: only a SHA-256 hash is persisted on
 * the Keycloak client, and the plaintext is returned once at registration and never again.
 * Losing it means the client can no longer manage itself — which RFC 7592 accepts, and which is
 * the right trade against keeping a recoverable secret on every client record.
 *
 * The token deliberately does NOT expire. RFC 7592 §2: "the registration access token SHOULD
 * NOT expire while a client is still actively registered", so that a developer cannot be locked
 * out of managing their own client.
