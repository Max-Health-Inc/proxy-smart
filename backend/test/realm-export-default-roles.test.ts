/**
 * Every seeded user must receive the realm's DEFAULT ROLE COMPOSITE, not a hand-written copy of
 * the roles inside it.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS GUARDS. `default-roles-proxy-smart` grants `offline_access` and `user`, but no
 * seeded user was assigned it — each declared explicit `realmRoles` instead, and a realm import
 * takes that list literally. `testuser` and `doctor` had `offline_access` hand-patched back in;
 * `admin` did not. So `admin` could log in and then fail the token exchange with
 * "Offline tokens not allowed for the user or client" — after a successful login, which reads as
 * a broken server. Reproduced against beta 2026-08-01: identical request, only the requested
 * scope differing, issues a token without `offline_access` and fails with it.
 *
 * Asserting "admin has offline_access" would have re-fixed the instance and left the shape
 * intact, so these assert the shape: the composite is the single source of baseline roles, and
 * nobody may restate its contents per-user.
