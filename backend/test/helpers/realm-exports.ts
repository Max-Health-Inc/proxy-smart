 * Every realm export these tests should validate.

 * moved out of this repository: they name one operator's users, clients and
 * identity providers, so they live in proxy-smart-infra. A hardcoded list would
 * have made this repo's tests fail the moment they left, and — worse — would
 * have quietly stopped covering them.
 *
 * REALM_EXPORT_PATHS lets another repository point these same tests at its own
 * realms instead of forking the assertions. That is how proxy-smart-infra
 * validates prod and beta: one copy of the rules, two sets of data.
