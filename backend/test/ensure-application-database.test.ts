/**
 * Creating the application database at startup.
 *
 * THE OUTAGE THIS PREVENTS. RDS creates only the database its `databaseName` names, and Postgres
 * runs init.sql only on a fresh volume — so nothing created `proxy_smart`, and production answered
 * every FHIR request with 500 `database "proxy_smart" does not exist` for months, because resolving
 * a FHIR server reads the admin-config store that lives in it.
 *
 * What is worth pinning is not the happy path but the three ways this could make things worse:
 * throwing on a database that is merely unreachable, treating a lost race as a failure, and
 * connecting to the very database it is trying to create.
