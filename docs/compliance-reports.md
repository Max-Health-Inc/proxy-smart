# Compliance Reports

Every SMART compliance run publishes its Inferno output here. The reports are
build artifacts of the [SMART Compliance Tests][workflow] workflow, attached to
this site at deploy time rather than committed to the repository.

## Latest runs

<!-- linkcheck: external /compliance/ -->


| Stage | Target | Report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | local Docker stack | [summary](/compliance/dev/summary.json) · [Inferno output](/compliance/dev/inferno-output.log) |
| `beta` | VPS | [summary](/compliance/beta/summary.json) · [Inferno output](/compliance/beta/inferno-output.log) |
| `production` | AWS | [summary](/compliance/production/summary.json) · [Inferno output](/compliance/production/inferno-output.log) |

A stage shows nothing until it has run at least once within the artifact
retention window. `summary.json` carries the counts and a link back to the run:

<!-- doccheck: skip — sample output, not code -->

```

## Why these are not in the repository

They used to be committed to `develop` after each run. Because the Inferno log
and the Keycloak log are regenerated every time, each run produced a few hundred
lines of diff, which meant a promotion PR that changed no source at all still
looked like a real change — [#954][pr954] carried 75 additions and 151 deletions
of pure log churn.

Publishing them as artifacts also let the compliance workflow drop `contents:
write` and the app token it needed to push past branch protection.
