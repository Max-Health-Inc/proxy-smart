# Version Management Tutorial

This tutorial explains how the version management system works in the Proxy Smart project. The system is designed to keep all package.json files synchronized across the monorepo and automate versioning for different release types.

## Overview

The version management system consists of:
- **Central Script**: `scripts/version.js` - Main version management logic
- **Git Hooks**: `.githooks/pre-commit` - Automatic version synchronization
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated version validation and release workflows
- **NPM Scripts**: Convenient commands for version operations

## Architecture

### Multi-Package Structure

The project is a monorepo with multiple packages:
```
├── package.json            # Root package (master version)
├── backend/package.json    # Backend service
├── ui/package.json         # Frontend React application
├── infra/package.json      # CDK infrastructure
└── scripts/package.json    # Build & CI scripts
```

All packages must maintain version consistency, with the root `package.json` serving as the source of truth.

### Version Format

The system supports semantic versioning with pre-release identifiers:

```
X.Y.Z[-suffix[.build[.sha]]]
```

- **X.Y.Z**: Standard semantic version (major.minor.patch)
- **suffix**: Release type (alpha, beta, or RELEASE for production)
- **build**: Build number for non-production releases (YYYYMMDDHHMM format)
- **sha**: Short commit SHA for non-production releases

Examples:
- `1.2.3-RELEASE` - Production release
- `1.2.3-alpha.202508031914.823869b` - Alpha release
- `1.2.3-beta.202508031915.a1b2c3d` - Beta release

## Core Script: `scripts/version.js`

The central script provides all version management functionality:

### Key Functions

1. **findPackageFiles()**: Automatically discovers all package.json files
2. **updateVersion()**: Updates version across all packages
3. **checkConsistency()**: Validates version consistency
4. **incrementVersion()**: Handles semantic version bumping
5. **getBaseVersion()**: Extracts base version without suffixes

### Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `sync` | Synchronize all packages to root version | `node scripts/version.js sync` |
| `bump [type]` | Increment version (patch/minor/major) | `node scripts/version.js bump minor` |
| `set <version>` | Set specific version | `node scripts/version.js set 1.2.3` |
| `check` | Validate version consistency | `node scripts/version.js check` |
| `base` | Get base version (no suffixes) | `node scripts/version.js base` |

## NPM Scripts Integration

The project provides convenient NPM scripts in the root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "version:sync": "node scripts/version.js sync",
    "version:bump": "node scripts/version.js bump",
    "version:bump:minor": "node scripts/version.js bump minor",
    "version:bump:major": "node scripts/version.js bump major",
    "version:set": "node scripts/version.js set",
    "version:check": "node scripts/version.js check",
    "version:base": "node scripts/version.js base",
    "precommit": "bun run version:sync"
  }
}
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Check current version consistency
bun run version:check

# Sync all packages to root version
bun run version:sync

# Bump patch version (1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
bun run version:bump

# Bump minor version (1.2.3 → 1.3.0)
bun run version:bump:minor

# Bump major version (1.2.3 → 2.0.0)
bun run version:bump:major

# Set specific version
bun run version:set 2.1.0

# Get base version without suffixes
bun run version:base
```

## Git Integration

### Pre-commit Hook

The `.githooks/pre-commit` hook automatically runs before each commit:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Checking version consistency..."
node scripts/version.js sync
git add **/package.json
echo "✅ Version consistency ensured"
```

This ensures that all commits maintain version consistency across packages.

### Setup Git Hooks

To enable git hooks:

```bash
# Run the setup script
node scripts/setup-hooks.js

# Or manually configure
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Version Validation (`version-check.yml`)

Automatically validates version consistency on pull requests:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop, test]
```

**What it does:**
- Checks that all package.json files have consistent versions
- Fails the PR if versions are inconsistent
- Provides clear feedback on version mismatches

### 2. Version Operations (`version-operations.yml`)

Reusable workflow for version operations:

**Inputs:**
- `operation`: 'validate' or 'update'
- `release_type`: 'alpha', 'beta', or 'production'
- `should_bump_version`: Whether to increment version
- `version_suffix`: Version suffix to apply

**Outputs:**
- `current_version`: Version before changes
- `new_version`: Version after changes
- `base_version`: Base version without suffixes
- `build_number`: Build number for non-production
- `short_sha`: Commit SHA
- `is_consistent`: Whether versions are consistent

### 3. Manual Version Bump (`manual-version-bump.yml`)

Allows manual version bumping through GitHub Actions:

**Triggers:**
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Configurable version type (minor/major)
- Optional custom version
- Target branch selection

**Process:**
1. Validates inputs
2. Calculates new version
3. Updates all package.json files
4. Updates README badge
5. Commits and pushes changes

## Release Process

### Branch Flow

The project uses a three-stage promotion model:

```
develop (alpha) ──auto-PR──▶ test (beta) ──manual-PR──▶ main (production)
```

Each branch has its own version suffix. When code is pushed, the release workflow creates a version-stamped tag and GitHub Release automatically.

### Alpha Releases (develop)

Alpha releases are created automatically on every push to `develop`:

1. **Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch (excluding bot commits)
2. **Workflow**: `release-alpha.yml` → `release-orchestrator.yml` → `version-operations.yml`
3. **Version Logic**: Current base version + alpha suffix with build number + short SHA
4. **Format**: `X.Y.Z-alpha.YYYYMMDDHHMM.SHA`
5. **Example**: `0.0.2-alpha.202603231607.00c7934f`

### Beta Releases (test)

Beta releases are created when code merges from `develop` into `test`:

1. **Trigger**: Push to `test` branch (excluding bot commits)
2. **Workflow**: `release-beta.yml` → `release-orchestrator.yml` → `version-operations.yml`
3. **Version Logic**: Current base version + beta suffix with build number + short SHA
4. **Format**: `X.Y.Z-beta.YYYYMMDDHHMM.SHA`
5. **Deploy**: Beta releases trigger deployment to the staging VPS via `deploy-beta.yml`

### Production Releases (main)

Production releases are created when code merges from `test` into `main`:

1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
2. **Workflow**: `release-production.yml` → `release-orchestrator.yml` → `version-operations.yml`
3. **Version Logic**: Base version with RELEASE suffix
4. **Format**: `X.Y.Z-RELEASE`

## Automated PR Promotion

### Auto-PR Creation (`create-pr.yml`)

When code is pushed to `develop`, the `create-pr.yml` workflow automatically:

1. Creates (or updates) a PR from `develop` → `test`
2. Waits for `Alpha Release` to finish on that commit
3. Enables GitHub auto-merge, so the PR merges once all required checks pass

Similarly, when code merges to `test`, a PR from `test` → `main` is created -- but this one requires manual review before merge.

The PR is created on **every** push to `develop` and `test`, including bot commits.
Only the steps that push a branch (version-conflict resolution) skip themselves on
`[proxy-smart-releaser]` commits, which is what prevents the workflow re-triggering
itself. Guarding the whole job instead used to mean a real change followed by a
version-sync commit produced no PR at all, because the sync commit was the last
push. The `Alpha Release` wait is likewise skipped for those commits -- they never
produce an alpha release, so waiting on one only burned the timeout.

### Version Conflict Auto-Resolution

Because each branch has different version suffixes (alpha vs beta vs production), the 5 `package.json` files always conflict between branches. The `create-pr.yml` workflow resolves this automatically:

1. **Detection**: The workflow checks if the source branch is behind the target (`commits_behind != 0`)
2. **Merge**: It merges the target branch into the source using `git merge -X ours` (keeping the source's versions)
3. **Rationale**: The source's version strings are ephemeral anyway -- `version-operations.yml` will immediately re-stamp the correct stage version after merge
4. **Bot commit**: The merge commit includes `[proxy-smart-releaser]` to prevent re-triggering release workflows

Example flow for `develop` → `test`:
```
1. develop has: 0.0.2-alpha.202603231607.00c7934f
2. test has:    0.0.2-beta.202603231553.5d372300
3. Workflow merges origin/test into develop with -X ours
4. Push → PR becomes conflict-free → auto-merge
5. version-operations re-stamps test as 0.0.2-beta.{new-build}.{new-sha}
```

### Skip Conditions

Bot-generated commits are filtered to prevent infinite loops:

| Commit message contains | Alpha Release | Create PR | Compliance Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| `proxy-smart-releaser` | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped (push only) |
| `🔄 Update version` | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped (push only) |
| `🤖 Update client APIs` | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped (push only) |

These workflows still run when triggered via `workflow_dispatch`, `workflow_call`, or schedule.

## Working with versions

Let the pre-commit hook do the synchronizing, and use `bun run version:check` to confirm the tree is consistent before you commit rather than after CI tells you it was not. Bumps follow semantic versioning: patch for bug fixes, minor for backwards-compatible additions, major for breaking changes.

`bun run version:set` exists for hotfixes and for pinning a specific version. Because it bypasses the normal bump, run `version:check` afterwards and say in the commit message why the version was set by hand.

Versions flow through the branches automatically. Feature branches merge into `develop`, which produces alpha versions; an auto-PR promotes `develop` to `test`, which auto-merges and produces beta versions deployed to the VPS; a reviewed PR promotes `test` to `main` for production versions. Hotfixes go straight to `main` and are the one case where the version bump is manual.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Version Inconsistency Error**
   ```bash
   ❌ backend/package.json: 1.2.3 (expected: 1.2.4)
   ```
   **Solution**: Run `bun run version:sync`

2. **Git Hook Not Working**
   ```bash
   # Re-setup hooks
   node scripts/setup-hooks.js
   ```

3. **CI/CD Version Validation Failure**
   - Check all package.json files manually
   - Run `bun run version:check` locally
   - Sync versions and commit changes

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check which packages exist
node scripts/version.js sync --dry-run

# Manually inspect versions
find . -name "package.json" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -exec echo {} \; -exec jq -r '.version' {} \;

# Reset all versions to root
bun run version:sync
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Version Formats

For special releases, you can set custom versions:

```bash
# Release candidate
bun run version:set 2.0.0-rc.1

# Custom suffix
bun run version:set 1.5.0-hotfix.1

# Production release
bun run version:set 1.2.3-RELEASE
```

### Programmatic Usage

You can import and use the version script functions:

```javascript
import { 
  getCurrentVersion, 
  updateVersion, 
  checkConsistency 
} from './scripts/version.js';

const currentVersion = getCurrentVersion();
const isConsistent = checkConsistency();
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The version management system is deeply integrated with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Synchronizes all package.json files before every commit
2. **PR Validation**: `version-check.yml` ensures version consistency on pull requests
3. **Auto-Release**: Push to `develop`/`test`/`main` triggers stage-specific release workflows
4. **Auto-PR**: `create-pr.yml` promotes code through branches with conflict resolution
5. **Auto-Merge**: `develop` → `test` PRs merge automatically after checks pass
6. **Changelog**: AI-powered changelog generation from commit history (OpenAI)
7. **Compliance**: SMART Inferno compliance tests run on real code merges
8. **Deploy**: Beta releases deploy to the staging VPS automatically

The point of all this is that no package version is ever set by hand in normal operation. The pre-commit hook keeps the monorepo synchronized, CI validation catches the cases it cannot, and the branch a commit lands on determines the release type. What is left to decide is the size of the bump.
